		<li>Start by creating your cat-master persona! Select your
			kitty-name and a password. Next, you’re ready to log-in to CatLand
			(it looks a lot like America).</li>

		<li>Choose which city you’d like to live your feline adventures.
		</li>

		<li>In that city, you’ll have to select restaurants where you’d
			like to battle. Each battle is a quiz, and the higher-rated the
			restaurant, the harder the question.</li>

		<li>If you win the battle, you gain a new kitty-friend in the
			form of a card. As winning battles is more difficult in a
			higher-rated restaurant, the prize-kittens you win from them are more
			powerful.</li>

		<li>Be aware, don’t lose all your milk-energy! You lose energy by
			losing quiz-battles and by going places too far away from where you
			are.</li>

		<li>After winning three battles, you’re going to upset The Evil
			Alley Cat. This cat is one mean (but cute) boss hiding at one of the
			restaurants. You don’t need to fight the boss immediately, and can
			continue visiting restaurants that you haven’t yet been to in order
			to gather the perfect cat posse to fight to the boss.</li>

		<li>Once you decide you’re ready for the final battle, go to its
			restaurant. The boss will play its card. You’ll need pick your own
			card, and most importantly, the quality of the cat that you think
			will beat the boss. Do you think your kitty is more energetic than
			the boss? Select ‘energy’! Do you think your cat is more intelligent
			than the boss? Select ‘intelligence.’</li>

		<li>If your chosen kitty beats the boss, you win. If you tie,
			you’ll do it all again. And if you lose, well… don’t worry, cats have
			extra lives, play another game!</li>
